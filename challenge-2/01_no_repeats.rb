# Write a function, `no_repeats(year_start, year_end)`, which takes a
# range of years and outputs those years which do not have any
# repeated digits.
#
# You should probably write a helper function, `no_repeat?(year)` which
# returns true/false if a single year doesn't have a repeat.
#
# Difficulty: 1/5
